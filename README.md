# MutualDemise
MutualDemise is a plugin intended for use in server events or fun amongst friends. The plugin was made customizable so it can be applied differently. For example, you could have a challenge where one player tries to die and the others try to stop them, the consequence of them dying being everyone else dies. Or, you could have a special challenge added to a survival playthrough where if one person dies, someone random dies (or everyone dies!). Have fun with it!

## Installation
1. Download the latest jar from the releases tab
2. Add the jar to your plugins folder
3. Restart & don't die!

## config.yml
The config.yml file was designed to be as simple as possible. If `everyone_dies` is true, if one player dies, everyone dies. If false, the amount of players set below will die. 
```yaml
everyone_dies: false # Set true if everyone should die if someone dies
random_kill_count: 1 # Set how many players should die if everyone_dies is false
```
